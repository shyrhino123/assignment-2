                <h3> Introduction </h3>
                <p>
                For this assignment we were tasked with redesigning and coding one page of a website while keeping accessibility and
                responsiveness in mind. I chose to redesign Bagel Gourmet's wesbite since it is one of my favorite resturants in Providence
                and the website hasn't been updated in many years. The food, workers, and physical restuarant location are top notch and I want to make sure 
                that their website reflects that too.  
                </p>
                
                <h3> Original Website</h3>
                <img class="case_study_img" src="Responsive_design/original.png" alt="Bagel gourmet's original website. Maroon background and white text.">
                <a href="http://bagelgourmetcafe.com/">http://bagelgourmetcafe.com/</a>
                <p> The original website has very outdate information and design. Overall the text is cluttered, the colors have low contrast, and
                    the images are all layered over each other. Let's take a more in-depth look at the user pain points. 
                </p> 
                
                <h3> Pain Points </h3>
                <div>
                    <h4> Visual Issues</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The sizing and boldness of the fonts do not follow a consistent heirarchy. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There are multiple focal points competing for attention and generally not visually engaging. 
                        </li>
                        <li> Too many different text colors and fonts. </li>
                        <li> The images are cluttered and layered together. </li>
                        <li> Very cluttered on the left and a lot of whitespace on the right side. </li>
                        <li> Some things that are underlined denote a link, but other things that are underlined
                            are not links.  </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4> Conceptual Model</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> This is a wesbite landing page for a resturant and it roughly follows the general conceptual model that 
                            people have for these types of websites: there is the nav bar a the top and a description of the website 
                            with some photos under that. 
                        </li>
                        <li> However, the places where it says hours is very confusing because it only includes
                            the hours that they are open for delivery but not the hours that the store is actually open for. Making it very
                            confusing to me what the target audience of the website is. </li>
                        <li>Additionally, you can also place orders on the website, but that isn't advertised or apparent on the landling
                            page, you can only tell if you click into menu nav link. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4> Accessibility Problems </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> The color contrast on some of the text is very low. For example, the bright red text on the
                            cream background is pretty low contrast and the red curisive on the logo blends into the 
                            brown background of the bagels. 
                        </li>
                        <li> The menu bar buttons have a very small touch area and the font size is small. </li>
                        <li> None of the images have alt text for visually impaired users. </li>
                        <li> The headings also do not follow the H1, H2, etc. html tags. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4> WebAIM WAVE Accessibility </h4>
                    <p> The WAVE accessibility tool revealed issues that I had mentioned about such as empty alt text, 
                        inconsistent type heirarchy, small text, and low color contrast. But there were a couple issues that I 
                        didn't catch such as not defining a language in the head of the html and there were 
                        a couple empty heading tags. </p>
    
                </div>
                <h3> Lo-fi Wireframing </h3>
                <img src="Responsive_design/annotated-lofi.png" alt="Lo-fi Wireframing">
                <p> 
                    I wanted to keep generally the same informationand content as the original page, 
                    but change the layout to be much more clean and organized. I added three separate
                    sections: the landing section, description of the restuarant, and then information
                    on hours and locations.
                </p> 
                <p> 
                    Below is the lo-fi wireframe for all three screens and shows how the layout would be
                    responsive.

                <h3> Style Guide </h3>
                <p>In my style guide I included fonts, colors, and all the reusable components I had in my design.
                    Since my the orginal website doesn't have a lot of content on the main page, I also don't have
                    many interactive elements other than buttons and the nav bar.
